## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
python scripts/dev_setup.py

# 2. Start infrastructure
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d postgres redis elasticsearch

# 3. Start services
python api_gateway/main.py
python auth_service/main.py
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Full development environment with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Access services
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Auth Service
```

### API Documentation
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Auth Service: http://localhost:8001/docs

## 🔄 Migration Status

### ✅ Completed Services
1. **API Gateway** - Fully refactored and operational
2. **Auth Service** - Core refactoring completed, ready for testing

### 🚧 Next Phase (Remaining Services)
The foundation is now complete. Remaining services can be quickly refactored using the established patterns:

1. **User Service** - Apply standardized structure
2. **Product Service** - Implement search and catalog features  
3. **Order Service** - Add cart and order processing
4. **Payment Service** - Integrate payment gateways
5. **Notification Service** - Email/SMS notifications
6. **Analytics Service** - Reporting and metrics

Each service refactoring will follow the same pattern:
1. Update `main.py` to use `create_app()`
2. Migrate configuration to use `get_service_settings()`
3. Update models to extend `BaseDBModel`
4. Implement repository pattern
5. Add service-specific business logic
